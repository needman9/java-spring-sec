            <p>
                If you wish to try out this project, you are probably
                looking for the
                <strong>spring-security-xx.zip</strong>
                file, which contains all of the officially released
                JARs, a copy of all documentation, and two WAR
                artifacts. The two WAR artifacts are from the Contacts
                Sample and the Tutorial Sample application. The Tutorial
                Sample consists of a "bare bones" configuration that
                will get you up and running quickly, whereas the
                Contacts Sample illustrates more advanced features.
            </p>

            <p>
                The spring-security-xx-src.zip is intended for use with
                IDEs. It does not contain the files needed to compile
                Spring Security. It also does not contain the sources to
                the sample applications. If you need any of these files,
                please download from SVN.
