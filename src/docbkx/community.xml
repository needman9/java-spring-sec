    <info><title>Issue Tracking</title></info>
    
    <para>Spring Security uses JIRA to manage bug reports and enhancement
        requests. If you find a bug, please log a report using JIRA. Do not
        log it on the support forum, mailing list or by emailing the project's
        developers. Such approaches are ad-hoc and we prefer to manage bugs
        using a more formal process.</para>
    
    <para>If possible, in your issue report please provide a JUnit test
        that demonstrates any incorrect behaviour. Or, better yet, provide a
        patch that corrects the issue. Similarly, enhancements are welcome to
        be logged in the issue tracker, although we only accept commit enhancement requests
        if you include corresponding unit tests. This is necessary to ensure
        project test coverage is adequately maintained.</para>

<section xml:id="further-info">
    <info><title>Further Information</title></info>
    
    <para>Questions and comments on Spring Security are welcome. You can use the 
        Spring Community Forum web site at  
        <uri xlink:href="http://forum.springframework.org">http://forum.springframework.org</uri>
        to discuss Spring Security with other users of the framework. 
        Remember to use the JIRA for bug reports, as explained above.
        Everyone is also welcome to join the Acegisecurity-developer mailing
        list and participate in design discussions. It's also a good way of
        finding out what's happening with regard to release timing, and the
        traffic volume is quite light. Finally, our project home page (where
        you can obtain the latest release of the project and convenient links
        to Subversion, JIRA, mailing lists, forums etc) is at 
        <uri xlink:href="http://static.springframework.org/spring-security/site/">http://static.springframework.org/spring-security/site/</uri>.</para>
