        <para>Spring Security comes bundled with several JSP tag libraries
            that eases JSP writing. The tag libraries provide a range of different
            services.</para>

        <para>All taglib classes are included in the core
            <literal>spring-security-xx.jar</literal> file, with the
            <literal>security.tld</literal> located in the JAR's
            <literal>META-INF</literal> directory. This means for JSP 1.2+ web
            containers you can simply include the JAR in the WAR's
            <literal>WEB-INF/lib</literal> directory and it will be available. If
            you're using a JSP 1.1 container, you'll need to declare the JSP
            taglib in your <literal>web.xml file</literal>, and include
            <literal>security.tld</literal> in the <literal>WEB-INF/lib</literal>
            directory. The following fragment is added to
            <literal>web.xml</literal>:</para>
        
        <para><programlisting>&lt;taglib&gt;
            &lt;taglib-uri&gt;http://www.springframework.org/security/tags&lt;/taglib-uri&gt;
            &lt;taglib-location&gt;/WEB-INF/security.tld&lt;/taglib-location&gt;
            &lt;/taglib&gt;       </programlisting></para>

        <para>Now that you've configured the tag libraries, refer to the
            individual reference guide sections for details on how to use them.
            Note that when using the tags, you should include the taglib reference
            in your JSP: <programlisting>
                &lt;%@ taglib prefix='security' uri='http://www.springframework.org/security/tags' %&gt;
                
            </programlisting></para>
