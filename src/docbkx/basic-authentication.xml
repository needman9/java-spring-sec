    <title>Overview</title>
    
    <para>Spring Security provides a
        <literal>BasicProcessingFilter</literal> which is capable of
        processing basic authentication credentials presented in HTTP headers.
        This can be used for authenticating calls made by Spring remoting
        protocols (such as Hessian and Burlap), as well as normal user agents
        (such as Internet Explorer and Navigator). The standard governing HTTP
        Basic Authentication is defined by RFC 1945, Section 11, and the
        <literal>BasicProcessingFilter</literal> conforms with this RFC. Basic
        Authentication is an attractive approach to authentication, because it
        is very widely deployed in user agents and implementation is extremely
        simple (it's just a Base64 encoding of the username:password,
        specified in an HTTP header).</para>

    <para>To implement HTTP Basic Authentication, it is necessary to
        define <literal>BasicProcessingFilter</literal> in the filter chain.
        The application context will need to define the
        <literal>BasicProcessingFilter</literal> and its required
        collaborator:</para>
    
    <para><programlisting>
        &lt;bean id="basicProcessingFilter" class="org.springframework.security.ui.basicauth.BasicProcessingFilter"&gt;
        &lt;property name="authenticationManager"&gt;&lt;ref bean="authenticationManager"/&gt;&lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;property name="authenticationEntryPoint"&gt;&lt;ref bean="authenticationEntryPoint"/&gt;&lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;/bean&gt;
        
        &lt;bean id="authenticationEntryPoint"
        class="org.springframework.security.ui.basicauth.BasicProcessingFilterEntryPoint"&gt;
        &lt;property name="realmName"&gt;&lt;value&gt;Name Of Your Realm&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/property&gt;
        &lt;/bean&gt;
        
    </programlisting></para>
    
    <para>The configured <literal>AuthenticationManager</literal>
        processes each authentication request. If authentication fails, the
        configured <literal>AuthenticationEntryPoint</literal> will be used to
        retry the authentication process. Usually you will use the
        <literal>BasicProcessingFilterEntryPoint</literal>, which returns a
        401 response with a suitable header to retry HTTP Basic
        authentication. If authentication is successful, the resulting
        <literal>Authentication</literal> object will be placed into the
        <literal>SecurityContextHolder</literal>.</para>
    
    <para>If the authentication event was successful, or authentication
        was not attempted because the HTTP header did not contain a supported
        authentication request, the filter chain will continue as normal. The
        only time the filter chain will be interrupted is if authentication
        fails and the <literal>AuthenticationEntryPoint</literal> is called,
        as discussed in the previous paragraph</para>
