  <info><title>Pre-Authentication Scenarios</title></info>
  <para>
    There are situations where you want to use Spring Security for authorization, but the user has already been reliably authenticated
    by some external system prior to accessing the application. We refer to these situations as <quote>pre-authenticated</quote>
    scenarios. Examples include X.509, Siteminder and authentication by the J2EE container in which the application is running. 
    When using pre-authentication, Spring Security has to
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>Identify the user making the request.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Obtain the authorities for the user.</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    The details will depend on the external authentication mechanism. A user might be identified by their certificate 
    information in the case of X.509, or by an HTTP request header, in the case of Siteminder. In some cases, the external
    mechanism may supply role/authority information for the user but in others the authorities must be obtained from a separate
    source.
