  <h1>Acegi Security Downloads</h1>
  <p>If you wish to try out this project, you are probably looking for the
  <strong>acegi-security-xx.zip</strong> file, which contains all of the officially
  released JARs, a copy of all documentation, and one WAR artifact from the Contacts
  Sample application.</p>
  
  <p>Please note that in order to reduce download size, we only include in the
  release ZIP one of the WAR artifacts produced by the Contacts Sample application.
  The WAR artifact we include is suitable for standalone deployment (specifically, it
  does not require a CAS server or container adapter or X509 setup). The official release ZIP
  therefore probably contains what you need, especially if you're initially
  evaluating the project. If you wish to deploy the other WAR artifacts produced by
  the Contacts Sample application (ie those that target CAS, container adapters and X509 usage),
  you will need to build Acegi Security from source.
  
  <p>The acegi-security-xx-src.zip is intended to use with IDEs. It does not contain the
  files needed to compile Acegi Security. It also does not contain the sources to the
  sample applications. If you need any of these files, please download from CVS.</p>
  
  <h2>Official Releases</h2>
  <p>The official release ZIP files are available from the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=104215">Sourceforge File Release System</a>.</p>
  <h2>Maven Dependencies</h2>
  <p>The Acegi Security JARs are also available via the
  <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/acegisecurity">iBiblio Maven Repository</a>.</p>
  <h2>Building From Source</h2>
  <p>Detailed instructions on downloading from CVS and building from source
  are provided on the <a href="building.html">Building with Maven</a>
  page.</p>
  <h2>CVS Snapshots</h2>
  <p>
  If you don't wish to access CVS directly, we provide
  <a href="http://acegisecurity.sourceforge.net/nightly/">nightly CVS exports</a> for your convenience. 
  </p>
  <p>
  If you'd like a full CVS tarball (including all past revisions; not recommended), you can
  find it <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/acegisecurity-cvsroot.tar.bz2">here</a>.
