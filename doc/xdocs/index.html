      <UL>
        <LI><B>It is ready NOW.</B> As explained in the reference guide, the API 
        is now quite stable. We also use the <A 
        href="http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html">Apache APR Project 
        Versioning Guidelines</A> so you can identify backward 
        compatibility.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Easy to use:</B> View our samples/quick-start directory for XML 
        you can simply copy and paste into applicationContext.xml and web.xml. 
        From there it's easy to customise Acegi Security to your unique security 
        needs.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Enterprise-wide single sign on:</B> Using Yale University's open 
        source <A href="http://www.yale.edu/tp/auth/">Central Authentication 
        Service</A> (CAS), the Acegi Security System for Spring can participate 
        in an enterprise-wide single sign on environment. You no longer need 
        every web application to have its own authentication database. Nor are 
        you restricted to single sign on across a single web container. Advanced 
        single sign on features like proxy support and forced refresh of logins 
        are supported by both CAS and Acegi Security.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Reuses your Spring expertise:</B> We use Spring application 
        contexts for all configuration, which should help Spring developers get 
        up-to-speed nice and quickly.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Domain object instance security:</B> In many applications it's 
        desirable to define Access Control Lists (ACLs) for individual domain 
        object instances. We provide a comprehensive ACL package with features 
        including integer bit masking, permission inheritence (including 
        blocking), a JDBC-backed ACL repository, caching and a pluggable, 
        interface-driven design.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Non-intrusive setup:</B> The entire security system can operate 
        within a single web application using the provided filters. There is no 
        need to make special changes or deploy libraries to your Servlet or EJB 
        container.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Full (but optional) container integration:</B> The credential 
        collection and authorization capabilities of your Servlet or EJB 
        container can be fully utilised via included "container adapters". We 
        currently support Catalina (Tomcat), Jetty, JBoss and Resin, with 
        additional containers easily added.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Keeps your objects free of security code:</B> Many applications 
        need to secure data at the bean level based on any combination of 
        parameters (user, time of day, authorities held, method being invoked, 
        parameter on method being invoked....). This package gives you this 
        flexibility without adding security code to your Spring business 
        objects.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Secures your HTTP requests as well:</B> In addition to securing 
        your beans, the project also secures your HTTP requests. No longer is it 
        necessary to rely on web.xml security constraints. Best of all, your 
        HTTP requests can now be secured by your choice of regular expressions 
        or Apache Ant paths, along with pluggable authentication, authorization 
        and run-as replacement managers.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Channel security:</B> The Acegi Security System for Spring can 
        automatically redirect requests across an appropriate transport channel. 
        Whilst flexible enough to support any of your "channel" requirements (eg 
        the remote user is a human, not a robot), a common channel security 
        feature is to ensure your secure pages will only be available over 
        HTTPS, and your public pages only over HTTP. Acegi Security also 
        supports unusual port combinations and pluggable transport decision 
        managers.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Supports HTTP BASIC authentication:</B> Perfect for remoting 
        protocols or those web applications that prefer a simple browser pop-up 
        (rather than a form login), Acegi Security can directly process HTTP 
        BASIC authentication requests as per RFC 1945.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Convenient security taglib:</B> Your JSP files can use our taglib 
        to ensure that protected content like links and messages are only 
        displayed to users holding the appropriate granted authorities.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Application context or attribute-based configuration:</B> You 
        select the method used to configure your security environment. The 
        project supports configuration via Spring application contexts as well 
        as Jakarta Commons Attributes.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Various authentication backends:</B> We include the ability to 
        retrieve your user and granted authority definitions from either an XML 
        file or JDBC datasource. Alternatively, you can implement the 
        single-method DAO interface and obtain authentication details from 
        anywhere you like.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Event support:</B> Building upon Spring's 
        <CODE>ApplicationEvent</CODE> services, you can write your own listeners 
        for login, invalid password and account disabled events. This enables 
        you to implement account lockout and audit log systems, with complete 
        decoupling from Acegi Security code.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Easy integration with existing databases:</B> Our implementations 
        have been designed to make it very easy to use your existing 
        authentication schema and data (without modification).<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Caching:</B> Use our <A 
        href="http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/">EHCACHE</A> wrapper to cache your 
        authentication information, or plug in your own cache implementation. 
        This flexibility means your database (or other authentication 
        repository) is not repeatedly queried for authentication 
        information.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Pluggable architecture:</B> Every critical aspect of the package 
        has been modelled using high cohesion, loose coupling, interface-driven 
        design principles. You can easily replace, customise or extend parts of 
        the package.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Startup-time validation:</B> Every critical object dependency and 
        configuration parameter is validated at application context startup 
        time. Security configuration errors are therefore detected early and 
        corrected quickly.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Remoting support:</B> Does your project use a rich client? Not a 
        problem. Acegi Security integrates with standard Spring remoting 
        protocols, because it automatically processes the HTTP BASIC 
        authentication headers they present. Add our BASIC authentication filter 
        to your web.xml and you're done.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Advanced password encoding:</B> Of course, passwords in your 
        authentication repository need not be in plain text. We support both SHA 
        and MD5 encoding, and also pluggable "salt" providers to maximise 
        password security.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Run-as replacement:</B> The security system fully supports 
        temporarily replacing the authenticated user for the duration of the web 
        request or bean invocation. This enables you to build public-facing 
        object tiers with different security configurations than your backend 
        objects.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Unit tests:</B> A must-have of any quality security project, unit 
        tests are included. Clover coverage is currently 98.3%.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Container integration tests:</B> To ensure the security project 
        properly operates with major container versions, we provide an 
        integration test system that deploys those containers from scratch and 
        fully tests our sample web application from the perspective of a HTTP 
        client.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Supports your own unit tests:</B> We provide a number of classes 
        that assist with your own unit testing of secured business objects. For 
        example, you can change the authentication identity and its associated 
        granted authorities directly within your test methods.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Peer reviewed:</B> Whilst nothing is ever completely secure, 
        using an open source security package leverages the continuous design 
        and code quality improvements that emerge from peer review.<BR><BR>
        <LI><B>Thorough documentation:</B> All APIs are fully documented using 
        JavaDoc, with a 40+ page reference guide providing an easy-to-follow 
        introduction.<BR><BR>
