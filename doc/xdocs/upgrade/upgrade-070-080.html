<h1>Upgrading from 0.7.0 to 0.8.0</h1>

<p>
The following should help most casual users of the project update their
applications:

    <ul>

    <li>HttpSessionIntegrationFilter has been removed. Use net.sf.acegisecurity.context.HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter instead. 
    Note you will need to set the mandatory "context" property to something like "net.sf.acegisecurity.context.security.SecureContextImpl".
    It's not the default because we want no dependencies between the context package and the rest of Acegi Security.<br><br></li>
    
	<li>Filter ordering has changed. See the reference guide for confirmation of the correct ordering. Basically you should have
	HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter appear before any of your authentication mechanisms.<br><br></li>
    
	<li>IoC container hosted filter chains can now be used instead of lengthy web.xml declarations. See the reference guide or the
	Contacts Sample for further information.<br><br></li>

	<li>Certain classes have been moved to new packages: ContextHolderAwareRequestWrapper (and its filter),
	AuthenticationSimpleHttpInvokerRequestExecutor, ContextPropagatingRemoteInvocation,
	SecureContext (and its implementation). These classes were moved as part of refactorings aimed at
	improving the simplicity of the project's design.<br><br></li>

	<li>If you wish to use the new ConcurrentSessionController you must declare the HttpSessionEventPublisher context listener in your
	web.xml<br><br></li>

    <li>The JaasAuthenticationCallbackHandler interface has had it's setAuthentication method removed.
    The handle method now takes both the Callback and Authentication objects as arguments.<br><br></li>
    
    <li>Added AuthenticationException to the AutenticationEntryPoint.commence method signature.<br><br></li>
    
    <li>Added AccessDeniedException to the SecurityEncorcementFilter.sendAccessDeniedError method signature.<br><br></li>

    </ul>
