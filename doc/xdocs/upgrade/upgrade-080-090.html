<h1>Upgrading from 0.8.0 to 1.0.0</h1>

<p>
The following should help most casual users of the project update their
applications:

    <ul>

    <li>The most significant change in 0.9.0 is that <code>ContextHolder</code> and all of its
    related classes have been removed. This significant change was made for the sake of consistency
    with the core Spring project's approach of a single <code>ThreadLocal</code> per use case, 
    instead of a shared <code>ThreadLocal</code> for multiple use cases as the previous 
    <code>ContextHolder</code> allowed. <b>This is an important change in 0.9.0.</b> Many applications
    will need to modify their code (and possibly web views) if they directly interact with the old 
    <code>ContextHolder</code>. The replacement security <code>ThreadLocal</code> is called
    <a href="../multiproject/acegi-security/xref/net/sf/acegisecurity/context/SecurityContextHolder.html">
    SecurityContextHolder</a> and provides a single getter/setter for a
    <a href="../multiproject/acegi-security/xref/net/sf/acegisecurity/context/SecurityContextHolder.html">SecurityContext</a>.
    <code>SecurityContextHolder</code> guarantees to never return a <cod>null</code> <code>SecurityContext</code>.
    <code>SecurityContext</code> provides single getter/setter for <code>Authentication</code>.<BR><BR>
    
    To migrate, simply modify all your code that previously worked with <code>ContextHolder</code>,
    <code>SecureContext</code> and <code>Context</code> to directly call <code>SecurityContextHolder</code>
    and work with the <code>SecurityContext</code> (instead of the now removed <code>Context</code>
    and <code>SecureContext</code> interfaces).<br><br>
    
    We apologise for the inconvenience, but on a more positive note this means you receive strict
    type checking, you no longer need to mess around with casting to and from <code>Context</code>
    implementations, your applications no longer need to perform checking of <code>null</code> and
    unexpected <code>Context</code> implementation types, and the new <code>SecurityContextHolder</code>
    is an <code>InheritableThreadLocal</code> - which should make life easier in rich client 
    environments.<br><br></li>

    <li>AbstractProcessingFilter has changed its getter/setter approach used for customised
    authentication exception directions. See the <a href="../multiproject/acegi-security/xref/net/sf/acegisecurity/ui/AbstractProcessingFilter.html">
    AbstractProcessingFilter JavaDocs</a> to learn more.<br><br></li>
    
    <li>AnonymousProcessingFilter now has a removeAfterRequest property, which defaults to true. This
    will cause the anonymous authentication token to be set to null at the end of each request, thus
    avoiding the expense of creating a HttpSession in HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter. You may
    set this property to false if you would like the anoymous authentication token to be preserved,
    which would be an unusual requirement.<br><br></li>
    
	<li>Event publishing has been refactored. New event classes have been added, and the location of
	LoggerListener has changed. See the net.sf.acegisecurity.event package.</li>
		
    </ul>
