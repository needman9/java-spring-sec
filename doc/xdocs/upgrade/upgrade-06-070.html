<title>Acegi Security - Upgrading from version 0.6 to 0.7</title>

<h1>Upgrading from 0.6 to 0.7.0</h1>

<p>
The following should help most casual users of the project update their
applications:
<ul>
<li>MethodDefinitionMap, which is usually used by MethodSecurityInterceptor
  for its objectDefinitionSource property, has been changed. From 0.7, when
  MethodDefinitionMap is queried for configuration attributes associated with
  secure MethodInvocations, it will use any method matching in the method
  invocation class (as it always has) plus any method matching any interface
  the MethodInvocation class directly implements. So consider a PersonManager
  interface, a PersonManagerImpl class that implements it, and a definition of
  PersonManager.findAll=ROLE_FOO. In this example, any query for either
  PersonManager.findAll OR PersonManagerImpl.findAll will return ROLE_FOO.
  As we have always encouraged definition against the interface names (as per
  this example), this change should not adversely impact users. This change
  was necessary because of the new MethodDefinitionSourceAdvisor (see below).
  Refer to the MethodDefinitionMap JavaDocs for further clarification.</li>

<li>MethodDefinitionSourceAdvisor can now be used instead of defining proxies
  for secure business objects. The advisor is fully compatible with both
  MethodDefinitionMap and MethodDefinitionAttributes. Using an advisor allows
  caching of which methods the MethodSecurityInterceptor should handle, thus
  providing a performance benefit as MethodSecurityInterceptor is not called
  for public (non-secure) objects. It also simplifies configuration.</li>

<li>MethodSecurityInterceptor has moved from
  net.sf.acegisecurity.intercept.method.MethodSecurityInterceptor to
  net.sf.acegisecurity.intercept.method.aopalliance.MethodSecurityInterceptor.
  A simple find and replace will suffice to update your application contexts.</li>

<li>All of the EH-CACHE cache implementations provided with Acegi Security have
	now been refactored to use a net.sf.ehcache.Cache obtained from
	EhCacheManagerFactoryBean, which is included with Spring 1.1.1 and above.
	See http://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/spring/display/DISC/Caching+the+result+of+methods+using+Spring+and+EHCache
	for more about this bean, or the Contacts sample application for how to
	configure the EH-CACHE implementations provided with Acegi Security.
	Note the "cache" property is now required, and the old internally-managed
	cache properties have been removed.</li>
</ul>
