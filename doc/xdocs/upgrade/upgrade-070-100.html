<h1>Upgrading from 0.7.0 to 1.0.0</h1>

<p>
The following should help most casual users of the project update their
applications:

    <ul>

    <li>The JaasAuthenticationCallbackHandler interface has had it's setAuthentication method removed.
    The handle method now takes both the Callback and Authentication objects as arguments.</li>
    <li>Added AuthenticationException to the AutenticationEntryPoint.commence method signature.</li>
    <li>Added AccessDeniedException to the SecurityEncorcementFilter.sendAccessDeniedError method signature.</li>

    </ul>
