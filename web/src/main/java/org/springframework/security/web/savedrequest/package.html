Classes related top the caching of an <code>HttpServletRequest</code> which requires authentication. While the user is
logging in, the request is cached (using the RequestCache implementation) by the ExceptionTranslationFilter.
Once the user has been authenticated, the original request is restored following a redirect to a matching URL, and the
RequestCache is queried to obtain the original (matching) request.
