/**
 * Populates the {@link SecurityContextHolder} with information obtained from
 * the <code>HttpSession</code>.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The <code>HttpSession</code> will be queried to retrieve the
 * <code>SecurityContext</code> that should be stored against the
 * <code>SecurityContextHolder</code> for the duration of the web request. At
 * the end of the web request, any updates made to the
 * <code>SecurityContextHolder</code> will be persisted back to the
 * <code>HttpSession</code> by this filter.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * If a valid <code>SecurityContext</code> cannot be obtained from the
 * <code>HttpSession</code> for whatever reason, a fresh
 * <code>SecurityContext</code> will be created and used instead. The created
 * object will be of the instance defined by the {@link #setContextClass(Class)}
 * method (which defaults to {@link org.springframework.security.core.context.SecurityContextImpl}.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * No <code>HttpSession</code> will be created by this filter if one does not
 * already exist. If at the end of the web request the <code>HttpSession</code>
 * does not exist, a <code>HttpSession</code> will <b>only</b> be created if
 * the current contents of the <code>SecurityContextHolder</code> are not
 * {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)} to a <code>new</code>
 * instance of {@link #setContextClass(Class)}. This avoids needless
 * <code>HttpSession</code> creation, but automates the storage of changes
 * made to the <code>SecurityContextHolder</code>. There is one exception to
 * this rule, that is if the {@link #forceEagerSessionCreation} property is
 * <code>true</code>, in which case sessions will always be created
 * irrespective of normal session-minimisation logic (the default is
 * <code>false</code>, as this is resource intensive and not recommended).
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * This filter will only execute once per request, to resolve servlet container
 * (specifically Weblogic) incompatibilities.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * If for whatever reason no <code>HttpSession</code> should <b>ever</b> be
 * created (eg this filter is only being used with Basic authentication or
 * similar clients that will never present the same <code>jsessionid</code>
 * etc), the {@link #setAllowSessionCreation(boolean)} should be set to
 * <code>false</code>. Only do this if you really need to conserve server
 * memory and ensure all classes using the <code>SecurityContextHolder</code>
 * are designed to have no persistence of the <code>SecurityContext</code>
 * between web requests. Please note that if {@link #forceEagerSessionCreation}
 * is <code>true</code>, the <code>allowSessionCreation</code> must also be
 * <code>true</code> (setting it to <code>false</code> will cause a startup
 * time error).
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * This filter MUST be executed BEFORE any authentication processing mechanisms.
 * Authentication processing mechanisms (eg BASIC, CAS processing filters etc)
 * expect the <code>SecurityContextHolder</code> to contain a valid
 * <code>SecurityContext</code> by the time they execute.
 * </p>
