         <p>
            This is the Maven generated site for the Acegi-Security project. It is generated as part of an
            automated daily build. We intend to expand the information on Acegi which is available here but for
            the moment, your best starting point for documentation is Ben Alex's
            original <a href="./reference/index.html">reference guide</a>
            which provides a comprehensive overview.
         </p>
         <p>
            For more information on running the build with Maven, see the
            <a href="./start/build.html">build</a> section of the getting started guide.
         </p>
         <p>
            The main other area of interest at the moment is the <a href="./maven-reports.html">generated reports</a> section.
            These are produced by the build on a daily basis and include complete Javadoc and source cross-reference.
