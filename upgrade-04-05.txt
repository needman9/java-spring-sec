===============================================================================
          ACEGI SECURITY SYSTEM FOR SPRING - UPGRADING FROM 0.4 TO 0.5
===============================================================================

Unfortunately, changes to the API and package locations were required. The
following should help most casual users of the project update their
applications:

- By default, AuthenticationProcessingFilter and SecurityEnforcementFilter now
  use Spring's WebApplicationContextUtils.getApplicationContext to load the 
  ApplicationContext in which their respective configs may be found. Ideally,
  move your configuration for these filters from the separate contexts you were
  using before, to the main context used by your webapp. Alternately, the old
  mechanism of having the filter load its own specific context is still
  supported, but the param specifying the location of this context has been
  changed to match the equivalent param as used by Spring's ContextLoader class.
  If you do still want to use this approach, just rename your param from 
  'appContextLocation' to 'contextConfigLocation'.


We hope you find the new features useful in your projects.
