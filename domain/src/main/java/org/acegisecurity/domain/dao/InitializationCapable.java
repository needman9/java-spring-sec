/**
 * Indicates an implementation capable of initializing an object, such that
 * any lazy loading is guaranteed to have been completed.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Structured as a separate interface (rather than a subclass of
 * <code>Dao</code>), as it is not required for all persistence strategies.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>In general the recommended approach to lazy initialization is as follows:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>Do not use OpenSessionInView. You can use it if you like, but you'll have
 * less difficulty in the long-run if you plan your use cases and adopt the other
 * recommendations below.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Set your mapping documents to use lazy initialization where possible. Only
 * mark an association as eager loaded if <b>every</b> single use case requires it
 * and you are happy with this eager loading being reflected in a mapping document
 * instead of Java code.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Subclass the <code>Dao</code> implementation and add use case specific finder/read
 * methods that will use the persistence engine's eager loading capabilities. <b>Generally
 * this approach will deliver the best overall application performance</b>, as you will
 * (i) only be eager loading if and when required and (ii) you are directly using the
 * persistence engine capabilities to do so. It also places the eager loading management
 * in the <code>Dao</code>, which is an ideal location to standardise it.</li>
 * 
 * <li>If you would prefer to achieve persistence engine independence and/or reduce
 * the number of <code>Dao</code> subclasses that exist in your application, you may
 * prefer to modify your services layer so that it uses the <code>InitializationCapable</code>
 * interface. However, this interface should be used judiciously given that it does
 * not allow the persistence engine to optimise eager loading for given use cases
 * and (probably) will lead to a mixture of places where fetching logic can be obtained.</li>
 * 
 * <p>Generally your best strategy is subclassing the <code>Dao</code>. It means the
 * most code, but it's also by far the most efficient and offers flexibility to further
 * fine-tune specific use cases. Whichever way you go, try to be consistent throughout
 * your application (this will ease your future migration and troubleshooting needs).
