[[servlet-authentication-unpwd]]
= Username/Password Authentication

One of the most common ways to authenticate a user is by validating a username and password.
As such, Spring Security provides comprehensive support for authenticating with a username and password.

[[servlet-authentication-unpwd-input]]
Spring Security provides the following built in mechanisms for reading a username and password from the `HttpServletRequest`:

* <<servlet-authentication-form,Form Login>>
* <<servlet-authentication-basic,Basic Authentication>>
* <<servlet-authentication-digest,Digest Authentication>>

[[servlet-authentication-unpwd-storage]]
Each of the supported mechanisms for reading a username and password can leverage any of the supported storage mechanisms:

* Simple Storage with <<servlet-authentication-inmemory>>
* Relational Databases with <<servlet-authentication-jdbc>>
* LDAP Servers with <<servlet-authentication-ldap>>
* Custom data stores with <<servlet-authentication-userdetailsservice>>
