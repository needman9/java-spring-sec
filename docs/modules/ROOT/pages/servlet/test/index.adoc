This section describes the testing support provided by Spring Security.

To use the Spring Security test support, you must include `spring-security-test-{spring-security-version}.jar` as a dependency of your project.

At a high level Spring Security's test support provides integration for:

* xref:servlet/test/method.adoc[Method Security] - provides test support for Spring Security's method security.
* xref:servlet/test/mockmvc.adoc[MockMvc] - Provides test support to integrate with Spring's `MockMvc`.
