		is used as the entry point by ExceptionTranslationFilter; for things like BasicAuthenticationfilter, they're smart enough to know they need a
		BasicAuthenticationProcessingFilterEntryPoint, so they use that one; here we have an entryPointOrder to say when we make the BasicEntryPoint,
		we will call setOrder(2) such that this app effectively will use somehing with a higher order as the app-wide default -->
