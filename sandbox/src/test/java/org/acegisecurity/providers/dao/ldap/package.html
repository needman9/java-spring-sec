	<h2>LDAP JUnit Tests and Helper Files.</h2>
	<p>
	Because the inter-class dependencies may not be obvious at first glance 
	they are documented for this package; most of this complexity is on account 
	of the JUnit design, hopefully future testing frameworks will be less intrusive.
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>LdapTestHelper</dt>
		<dd>Containing the majority of the code which references the 
		apache directory server classes, LdapTestHelper is designed 
		to be assigned as a static field in the BaseLdapTestCase, although 
		it can be used elsewhere.  LdapTestHelper contains all the code 
		needed to start, initialize, and shutdown the directory server.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>DirContentsInitializer</dt>
		<dd>DirContentsInitializer contains the JNDI code 
		used to load the directory server up with entries (users and groups).
		When I figure out how to correctly import LDIF files, DirContentsInitializer 
		will probably be radically simplified.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>BaseLdapTestCase</dt>
		<dd>Contains common methods and fields that will probably 
		be needed by any TestCase which interacts with the directory server, 
		including a static reference to a LdapTestHelper instance.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>DirSetupTestCase</dt>
		<dd>Contains some simple code designed to test that DirContentsInitializer 
		has functioned properly.  If these tests fail then the 
		other tests are expected to fail too.
		</dd>
		
		<dt>LdapPasswordAuthenticationTest</dt>
		<dd>Contains tests which configure a LdapPasswordAuthenticationDao bean and
		excersize it against the directory server.
		</dd>
