Classes related to the establishment of a security context for the duration of a request (such as
an HTTP or RMI invocation) and for the maintenance of the context between requests (by storing it in an HTTP sessio, for
example).
<p>
A security context is associated with the current execution thread for the duration of the request, making the
authentication information it contains available throughout all the layers of an application.
