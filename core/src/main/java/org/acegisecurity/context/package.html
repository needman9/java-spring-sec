Provides a "request context".
<p>
A request context is associated with the current execution thread. It holds

such as for authentication.</p>

<p><b>The majority of this package has been deprecated. Please use the
<code>SecurityContext</code> and <code>HttpSessionContextIntegrationFilter</code>
classes only.</b></p>
