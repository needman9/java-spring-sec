/**
 * A representation of a user <code>Principal</code>
 * that is registered with a standard <i>OAuth 2.0 Provider</i>.
 *
 * <p>
 * An OAuth 2.0 user is composed of one or more attributes, for example,
 * first name, middle name, last name, email, phone number, address, etc.
 * Each user attribute has a &quot;name&quot; and &quot;value&quot; and
 * is keyed by the &quot;name&quot; in {@link #getAttributes()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> Attribute names are <b><i>not</i></b> standardized between providers and therefore will vary.
 * Please consult the provider's API documentation for the set of supported user attribute names.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementation instances of this interface represent an {@link AuthenticatedPrincipal}
 * which is associated to an {@link Authentication} object
 * and may be accessed via {@link Authentication#getPrincipal()}.
