/**
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for building an <i>OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request</i>,
 * which is used as the redirect <code>URI</code> to the <i>Authorization Endpoint</i>.
 *
 * <p>
 * The returned redirect <code>URI</code> will include the following parameters as query components to the
 * <i>Authorization Endpoint</i> (using the &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot; format):
 * <ul>
 * <li>client identifier (required)</li>
 * <li>response type (required)</li>
 * <li>requested scope(s) (optional)</li>
 * <li>state (recommended)</li>
 * <li>redirection URI (optional) - the authorization server will send the user-agent back to once access is granted (or denied) by the end-user (resource owner)</li>
